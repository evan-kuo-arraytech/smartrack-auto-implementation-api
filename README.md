Customers are pressuring us to finish SmarTrack implementation as soon as possible. We also increasingly have sites that are signed up for SmarTrack Backtracking + SmarTrack Diffuse. So, we have developed a workflow that tries to minimize the total SmarTrack Backtracking + SmarTrack Diffuse implementation time. Typically, we start by turning on SmarTrack Diffuse alternating operation and we let it run. When we see a clear AM and/or PM backtracking period in the forecast, we turn off SmarTrack Diffuse and turn on the SmarTrack Backtracking learning moves, resuming Diffuse alternating operation afterward. After Backtracking learning has completed, we look out for clear days to perform the Backtracking gain evaluation, for which we also pause Diffuse. The goal is to create a service that automatically checks the weather forecast and executes the SmarTrack implementation tasks accordingly. John diagrammed the potential automation logic here.​

​
Currently, the learning and the gain analyses are run with a series of scripts. The goal is to incorporate these analyses into the auto-implementation workflow. Our analysis scripts are getting better all the time, but we need to think about how they will fit into an automated workflow. We’ll need to automate the fix file creation. John created a simple script for this (“create-fix-file.py” in smartrack-analysis-tools), but we probably want a more advanced solution (e.g., Can we train a machine learning model to pick out tricky knees?).
